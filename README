Requirements
============
FlikBak only requires a normal install of Ruby 2. No extra gems are required.

To use FlikBak you will need a Flickr API key and secret. Put them in config.rb. The first time you run FlikBack it will open the default browser for you to grant it permission to access your Flickr account. Flickr will display a code in the browser. Copy/paste this code into the terminal where requested. You only need to do this once.

Usage
=====
ruby flikbak.rb APIKEY SECRET TOKENS_DIR PHOTOS_DIR

APIKEY = your Flickr api key.
SECRET = your Flickr api secret.
TOKENS_DIR = full path of directory to store oauth tokens. If this gets deleted or emptied, flickbak will rebuild the oauth tokens using the browser.
PHOTOS_DIR = full path of directory to store downloaded photos and metadata.
