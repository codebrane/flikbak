Requirements
============
FlikBak only requires a normal install of Ruby 2. No extra gems are required.

To use FlikBak you will need a Flickr API key and secret. Put them in config.rb. The first time you run FlikBack it will open the default browser for you to grant it permission to access your Flickr account. Flickr will display a code in the browser. Copy/paste this code into the terminal where requested. You only need to do this once.

Usage
=====
ruby flikbak.rb PHOTOS_DIR

where PHOTOS_DIR is the full path to the directory where you want your Flickr photos to be stored. FlikBak will download the original version of each photo and create a JSON file with its metadata in each photo's directory in PHOTOS_DIR.

PHOTOS_DIR/PhotosetName/contacts.json
PHOTOS_DIR/PhotosetName/groups.json

Photos in sets
==============
