Requirements
============
FlikBak only requires a normal install of Ruby. No extra gems are required.

Usage
=====
ruby flikbak.rb API_KEY SECRET BACKUP_DIR PHOTO_TYPE

	API_KEY, SECRET
	---------------
	Before you can use FlikBak, you need to get an api key and secret from Flickr. Go to the page:
	http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.overview.html
	login to Flickr and click on "Apply for a new API Key".
	Choose a "Non-Commercial API Key", fill in the details and then note your api key and secret.
	Pass these to FlikBak to start backing up your photos.

	BACKUP_DIR
	----------
	This is the full path to the directory where you want to store your photos. The first part
	of the path must exist. e.g.
	/Users/flickr/photos/flickr-backup
	the directory /Users/flickr/photos must exist. The utility will create the "flickr-backup" directory.

	PHOTO_TYPE
	----------
	This determines which types of photo are backed up. The options are:
	square
	thumbnail
	small
	medium
	original

Photos not in sets
==================
Photos not in sets are downloaded to BACKUP_DIR.

Photos in sets
==============
Photos in sets are downloaded to:
BACKUP_DIR/PhotosetName/PhotoTitle.jpg
Weird characters in the photoset name and photo title such as " " "," "/" "\"
are changed to underscores "_" to allow them to be created as files on the disk.

Collections
===========
Currently there is no Flickr API to download collections information.

Videos
======
Currently there is no Flickr API to download videos. They can only be streamed using the
Flickr flash player.
