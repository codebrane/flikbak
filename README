Welcome to FlikBak!

FlikBak is a commandline utility that backs up your Flickr photos. To do so, enter the command:

ruby flikbak.rb BACKUP_DIR PHOTO_TYPE

BACKUP_DIR
----------
This is the full path to the directory where you want to store your photos. The first part
of the path must exist. e.g.
/Users/flickr/photos/flickr-backup
the directory /Users/flickr/photos must exist. The utility will create the "flickr-backup" directory.

PHOTO_TYPE
----------
This determines which types of photo are backed up. The options are:
square
thumbnail
small
medium
original

Photos not in sets
==================
Photos not in sets are downloaded to BACKUP_DIR.

Photos in sets
==============
Photos in sets are downloaded to:
BACKUP_DIR/PhotosetName/PhotoTitle.jpg
Weird characters in the photoset name and photo title such as " " "," "/" "\"
are changed to underscores "_" to allow them to be created as files on the disk.

Collections
===========
Currently there is no Flickr API to download collections information.

Videos
======
Currently there is no Flickr API to download videos. They can only be streamed using the
Flickr flash player.
