Welcome to FlikBak!

FlikBak is a commandline utility that downloads your Flickr photos to your computer.

o Usage
o Photos in sets
o Photos not in sets

Requirements
============
FlikBak only requires a normal install of Ruby 2. No extra gems are required.

To use FlikBak you will need a Flickr API key and secret. The first time you run FlikBack it will open the default browser for you to grant it permission to access your Flickr account. Flickr will display a code in the browser. Copy/paste this code into the terminal where requested. You only need to do this once as the OAuth tokens are stored in the TOKENS_DIR parameter.

Usage
=====
ruby flickbak.rb APIKEY SECRET TOKENS_DIR PHOTOS_DIR MODE OVERWRITE

APIKEY = your Flickr api key.
SECRET = your Flickr api secret.
TOKENS_DIR = full path of directory to store oauth tokens. If this gets deleted or emptied, flickbak will rebuild the oauth tokens using the browser.
PHOTOS_DIR = full path of directory to store downloaded photos and metadata.
MODE = One of: sets notinset collections
OVERWRITE = one of: overwrite keep

e.g. to download all your collections:
ruby flickbak.rb YOUR_APIKEY YOUR_SECRET /Users/you/flickr/tokens /Users/you/flickr/photos collections overwrite

After running the above your Flickr OAuth tokens will be stored in /Users/you/flickr/tokens. If you delete these, FlikBak will recreate them by asking you to grant permissions via the browser again. Your collections will be in /Users/you/flickr/photos/collections

If you have to cancel FlikBak during a lengthy sets download, use keep as the OVERWRITE parameter next time to skip over those you've already downloaded. If you need to redownload photos, set it to overwrite.
